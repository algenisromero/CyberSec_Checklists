# Malware Analysis Checklist

### 1. Preparation Phase:

- [ ] Virtualization software (VirtualBox, VMware) for creating isolated virtual machines.
- [ ] Cuckoo Sandbox for automated malware analysis in a controlled environment.
  - **Documentation:** Record details about the source and context of the malware sample, including any associated email attachments, URLs, or delivery methods.

### 2. Identification Phase:

- [ ] VirusTotal for submitting the malware sample and obtaining information from multiple antivirus engines.
- [ ] YARA for applying predefined rules and signatures to identify known malware patterns.
  - **Documentation:** Note any identified IOCs (e.g., MD5/SHA-256 hashes, file names, URLs) associated with the malware sample.

### 3. Static Analysis Phase:

- [ ] IDA Pro for disassembling the malware and analyzing its assembly code.
- [ ] PEiD for detecting packers, cryptors, and compilers used to obfuscate the malware.
  - **Documentation:** Analyze the code structure, identify potential malicious functions or routines, and document your findings.

### 4. Dynamic Analysis Phase:

- [ ] Process Monitor for capturing system events, file system changes, registry modifications, and network activity during malware execution.
- [ ] Wireshark for capturing and analyzing network traffic generated by the malware.
  - **Documentation:** Record observed behaviors, network communication details, and any anomalies or suspicious activities exhibited by the malware.

### 5. Code Analysis Phase:

- [ ] Ghidra for analyzing the assembly code, understanding the malware's functionality, and identifying vulnerabilities or exploits.
- [ ] OllyDbg or x64dbg for stepping through the code, setting breakpoints, and analyzing runtime behavior.
  - **Documentation:** Document your code analysis findings, including identified functions, potential vulnerabilities, and any encryption or packing techniques used.

### 6. Behavioral Analysis Phase:

- [ ] RegShot for taking before-and-after snapshots of the Windows registry to identify changes made by the malware.
- [ ] Process Explorer for monitoring running processes, DLLs, handles, and network connections.
  - **Documentation:** Document the malware's impact, system changes, persistence mechanisms, and any observed malicious behaviors.

### 7. Reporting Phase:

- [ ] MISP for managing and sharing malware analysis findings, IOCs, and reports with other security professionals.
- [ ] Markdown Editors (e.g., Visual Studio Code) for creating professional and well-formatted reports.
  - **Documentation:** Prepare a comprehensive report documenting the entire analysis process, including the malware's characteristics, behaviors, identified IOCs, and recommendations for mitigation.
